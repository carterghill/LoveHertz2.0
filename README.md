# LoveHertz2.0---revamp
LoveHertz2.0 with better object oriented coding.

Love Hertz has been an on again/off again project for a few years now, built in Love2D. The original version was a single screen platformer which could import levels created in tiled map editor. I felt that it was limited in what it could do, and to change it I knew I would basically have to start over from scratch, so that's what I did with Love Hertz 2.0. It is a game engine build entirely around a map editing system, and will eventually become the backbone of my upcoming game\

To use this software, download Love2D from http://love2d.org, and download the project. To run it, simply click and drag the project folder into the love2d executable. main.lua must be at the root of the folder, like: LoveHertz2.0 -> main.lua
